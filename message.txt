Antimatter Dimensions is not a game. Its a program.

this program will not bring you the joy and intensity of most games, but that's because it does not need to. it will instead bring you immense satisfaction. The satisfaction of a garden well maintained, not of a tough battle won.

This game is not for everyone. if you both don't have years of time to figure out the best strategies, nor the willingness to use a guide, steer clear. everyone else i suggest going as far as you can and then looking up a guide when you get stuck.

The gameplay really does, in the end, end up being watching numbers go up. But I and many others have played this game for well over 1000 hours on both the web version and steam version. it might sound boring, but once you get into it it becomes very addicting and quite fun.

its a very well optimized game, and runs well pretty much no matter what. the only criticism i could ever give this game is that even while following a guide, very occasionally i would run into essentially time walls, where for a day or two i would just have to wait for a number to go up. let me preface that time walls of that magnitude are very rare (i only encountered like 4 in my 1000 hours of playtime) though few hour long waits are decently common (usually after a prestige).

Cannot recommend this enough for anyone even remotely interested in incremental games, though you might not get much work done after installing it.Antimatter Dimensions is not a game. Its a program.
